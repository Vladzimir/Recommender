# Recommender
Implementation of a *Collaborative recommendation system*, which means it uses the user's past behaviour to recommend products to buy.

### Parts:

- **Model**: This contains the data about the past purchases (or similar behaviours)
- **Storage**: The presistent storage where the similarity sets are stored and retrieved, acts as a cache
- **Engine**: The similarity engine, which calculates the similarity score between two sets
